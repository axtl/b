# The Author #

I am [alexandru totolici]: occasional writer, habitual hacker, student of
sundry things.

I currently spend my time between [research] in the [Computer Science
Department] at the [University of British Columbia][UBC] in Vancouver, and
coding random things, most of which you can find on [GitHub].

You can find me on [LinkedIn], visit [«techtusiasmic»], where I curate
links about technology and design, or check out my irregular ramblings
[@xorbyte].


# The Tools #

I like practical minimalism and simple solutions. I enjoy Apple products,
something that often comes through in my writing.

I code mainly in [Sublime Text 2] or [Vim] on either an 11" MacBook Air
or my R&D [Debian Linux] box. I use [GitHub] for publishing code, and
[iTerm 2] with [oh-my-zsh] and [tmux] + [teamocil] for extreme sorcery.

If I'm writing something other than code, I usually turn to [Byword] on the
Mac, save to [Dropbox], and continue on iOS in [Textastic] or [iA Writer].
Textastic also doubles as a pretty solid code editor, and the Markdown support
is great.

I use [OmniFocus] to make sense of the things going on in my life, and [Reeder]
and [Instapaper] to keep track of the things going on in the world.


# The Site #

My 'web stuff' has been around the block a few times, and I think this would
be version #5. I've been on Blogger, WordPress, Tumblr, and settled now on a
static site built with [Octopress] and hosted on [GitHub Pages]. I've
previously sought advanced features and social sugar, but now I realize the
only thing one needs is a text editor and a domain to host on.
